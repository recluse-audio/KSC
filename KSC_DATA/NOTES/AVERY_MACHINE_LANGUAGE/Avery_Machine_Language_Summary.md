It looks like Avery was getting back to his roots. He loved this old DSP book. Always wanted to beat the neural nets with good ol' LPC.  Sure it's not as dynamic in encoding a signal given oodles of analysis time, but it will get you a 'pretty good' assessment of a signal in under 50ms.

Maybe speed is the key.
