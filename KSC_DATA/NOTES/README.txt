NOTES are markdown files that are appended to as the player finds "clues"
throughout the game. 

A note can be a hint
- right now the "puzzle" aspect is clicking in the right spot, random tapping would work
but will change that.

A note can also unlock new areas directly
- find a library card, take note, now library is unlocked.
- in code, it won't check the note for discovery conditionals (i think, maybe it will if im crazy)
