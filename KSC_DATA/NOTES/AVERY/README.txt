Avery disappears at the beginning of the story. Finding him is the primary thrust of this narrative.

He is a disorganized off-grid tech enthusiast and is by no means a super genius. But he's smart and motivated and
has the will to power.

Avery is a member of Christian's Simbolo(aka Signal irl) group, discussing the sketchy "M.U.R.D.E.R." cameras.

Searching his desk/cabinet we want players to be guided towards the following "clues".

A "root" note is equivalent to a "root" location. It is effectively a level.
The fundamental plot is, "Where is Avery?". Not sure this is a "level" because it is the whole story really.

A root note is equivalent to the file's title but will include a paragraph that leads to the bullet points. 
Each sub-scene (sub-note) is a bullet point in the file.

First note header: "Avery's Work Station"
Summary: "I've got to inspect Avery's work station, maybe there is something I can discern from that mess.
The rest of his house is just empty lacroix cans and kempswich wrappers."

Conclusions to have by end of AVERY level:

1.) Avery was working on something to mess with the audio tracking feature of the cameras.
    [ eventually it will be clear he was intercepting and changing the words and passing them along, modified surreptitiously. ]
    - DSP book
    - Bluetooth mic disassembled

    This accomplishes:
    - lead player to library
    - narrative contribution
    - heavy representation of the theme (engineering vs. ml black box)

2.) Avery had a powerful green lazer

    - user takes it with them
    - Avery used it to shine into the camera to disable it
    - plot payoff later shining in the eyes of Raven


3.) Avery wasn't alone

    - multiple cups in Avery locations
    - suspicious login on a saturday in the computer's login history
