We need to figure out what Avery was working on before he disappeared. See if there is a trip itinerary or a plane ticket or god forbid,
a note.

This messy desk belonged to Avery Benjamin, and before he found it in a dumpster, it was in a MCAD dorm room.
Years of paint and pencil leave their mark through scuff and dent.

Assorted projects cover every bit of surface area available. This guy was always involved in atleast
a half dozen in progress projects at a time.
